🛒 Vulnerable Shopping Web App – IDOR Demo

This repository contains a deliberately vulnerable shopping-style web application created for educational and security testing purposes.
It is designed to demonstrate the IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerability in a realistic e-commerce environment.

The project includes:

- Full source code of the vulnerable web app

- A pre-built Docker image for quick and easy testing

- Presentation about the IDOR

⚠️ Disclaimer:
This project is intentionally vulnerable.
Use it only in isolated environments (lab machines, VMs, private networks).
